# Serve multiple generative AI models

A company wants to deploy multiple large language models (LLMs) to a cluster to serve different workloads.
For example, they might want to deploy a Gemma3 model for a chatbot interface and a DeepSeek model for a recommendation application.
The company needs to ensure optimal serving performance for these LLMs.
By using an Inference Gateway, you can deploy these LLMs on your cluster with your chosen accelerator configuration in an `InferencePool`.
You can then route requests based on the model name (such as `chatbot` and `recommender`) and the `Criticality` property.

## How

The following diagram illustrates how an Inference Gateway routes requests to different models based on the model name.
The model name is extracted by [Body-Based routing](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/blob/main/pkg/bbr/README.md) (BBR)
 from the request body to the header. The header is then matched to dispatch
 requests to different `InferencePool` (and their EPPs) instances.

### Deploy Body-Based Routing

To enable body-based routing, you need to deploy the Body-Based Routing ExtProc server using Helm. Depending on your Gateway provider, you can use one of the following commands:

=== "GKE"

    ```bash
    helm install body-based-router \
      --set provider.name=gke \
      --version v0.5.1 \
      oci://registry.k8s.io/gateway-api-inference-extension/charts/body-based-routing
    ```

=== "Istio"

    ```bash
    helm install body-based-router \
      --set provider.name=istio \
      --version v0.5.1 \
      oci://registry.k8s.io/gateway-api-inference-extension/charts/body-based-routing
    ```

=== "Other"

    ```bash
    helm install body-based-router \
      --version v0.5.1 \
      oci://registry.k8s.io/gateway-api-inference-extension/charts/body-based-routing
    ```

### Configure HTTPRoute

This example illustrates a conceptual example regarding how to use the `HTTPRoute` object to route based on model name like “chatbot” or “recommender” to `InferencePool`.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: routes-to-llms
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: inference-gateway
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - type: Exact
        name: X-Gateway-Model-Name # (1)!
        value: chatbot
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: gemma3
      kind: InferencePool
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - type: Exact
        name: X-Gateway-Model-Name # (2)!
        value: recommender
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: deepseek-r1
      kind: InferencePool
```

1. [BBR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/blob/main/pkg/bbr/README.md) is being used to copy the model name from the request body to the header with key `X-Gateway-Model-Name`. The header can then be used in the `HTTPRoute` to route requests to different `InferencePool` instances.

## Try it out

1. Get the gateway IP:
```bash
IP=$(kubectl get gateway/inference-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}'); PORT=80
```

=== "Chat Completions API"

      1. Send a few requests to model `chatbot` as follows:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -i ${IP}:${PORT}/v1/chat/completions \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "model": "chatbot",
          "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the color of the sky?"}],
          "max_tokens": 100,
          "temperature": 0
        }'
      ```

      2. Send a few requests to model `recommender` as follows:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -i ${IP}:${PORT}/v1/chat/completions \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "model": "recommender",
          "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give me restaurant recommendations in Paris"}],
          "max_tokens": 100,
          "temperature": 0
        }'
      ```

=== "Completions API"

      1. Send a few requests to model `chatbot` as follows:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -i ${IP}:${PORT}/v1/completions \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
          "model": "chatbot",
          "prompt": "What is the color of the sky",
          "max_tokens": 100,
          "temperature": 0
        }'
      ```

      2. Send a few requests to model `recommender` as follows:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -i ${IP}:${PORT}/v1/completions \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
          "model": "recommender",
          "prompt": "Give me restaurant recommendations in Paris",
          "max_tokens": 100,
          "temperature": 0
        }'
      ```
